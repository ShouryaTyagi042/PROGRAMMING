Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes
Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling 
them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws.
Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five
times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.
Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica
